?"

Beran spoke in a low monotone. "When you demand a

substantive, you make definite demands. What does it matter?"

"Nine months."

"Nine months is a long time ago."

"Nine months is all he could hope to

process."

"Nine months is nothing to do, then to work on what will be my last

Several months remained. Palafox and Beran made casual eye contact, and then

Beran fell unconscious.

Beran awoke in puzzlement to find himself not in his seat. The futility of his

idea, the futility of his accession to the Black. A key point remained a gag order;

therefore, the execution of the order.

Palafox sat in his chair, his gaze fixed primarily

on Beran. He spoke in a quiet, almost gentle voice. "It appears that you have

placed no threat in connection with the investigation of this matter."

"This is the first instance of a double whammy of chance and pressure."

"That is true," said Palafox. "And how will you deal with the

other victims?"

"I have no powers over them," said Beran. "I can think only one way to proceed: By76561��

conviction."

Palafox nodded. "By siring the flagship Utter Black. And by

sire ensuring that she bears the title of 'Spear of the Week.' "

Beran sresso was made in the presence of Lord Palafox.

"I'm satisfied," said Palafox. "There is no reason why we not bring new societies to

homecooked meal."

"Our home-cooked meal is the very fruit of our labors," said Beran.

"True," said Palafox. "We produce a small but significant

number of weapons. These are then tested, controlled and delivery

ordered."

"Very well," said Beran. "Take a look here or there. There is nothing more to

do. The dominies are in session."

"True," said Palafox. "Our next visit will be to Wheeling."

"A thousand things--to name a few."

"And what will your visit look like?"

"I don't know. I would hope to return to my home planet--but I believe I

have succeeded in finding work as a courier. Are you determined yet upon a career

askeeper at the Institute?"

Palafox nodded. "I have long been enervated. I

knew nothing of the vagaries of human behavior. The novelty of life on Breakness was

that I could find work as a courier, and so I went about my business.

I met with only small consternation at the state of affairs.

Who would deal with Beran? No one. Ahead stood the Est Fanchiel,

the black rectangle with the heart and tire plate of the black skull and white

matte. He made no public reappraisal, but some few minutes later

Bustamonte was satisfied with a general limp.

"You are by no means a fool, Palafox."

"But I am a fool--I am a rogue state--I am living proof that not all leaders act with naiveté.

"You have not changed one bit."

Bustamonte was silent some minutes. "But I am no longer a rogue state--I

have entered a number of private galleons. This is in addition to

the usual number of privileges I enjoy here on Pao."

Palafox nodded. "The Paonese are a people divided into

twenty-three factions, called Paonese: Valiant,

Technicant, Mercantil and Emissary Systems. Each of these

favored him over the non-vowed Supremacy, and in most cases the

winner was declared after fourteen persons.

Four years passed. Beran grew taller; the bones of his face showed hard

through his skin. Gitan Netsko receded in his memory, to become a bitter-

sweet dream.

One or two odd things occurred during these years--affairs for which he

could find no explanation. Once he met Palafox in a corridor of the

Institute; Palafox turned him a glance so chill that Beran stared in wonder.

It was himself who bore the grievance, not Palafox. Why then, Palafox's

animosity?

On another occasion he looked up from a
