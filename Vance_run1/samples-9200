 out. "In these circumstances you need not concern yourself so much as an

individual."

Beran said, "I has special insight into the psychology of the Brumbos. I must act."

Palafox surveyed him through the wide net of his eyes. "Do you agree to this arrangement?"

"Yes, your child will be Panarch of Pao. You will attend the Institute, where your studies will

assist you as you study the

Cliffs of the Earth."

Beran took the opportunity to speak candidly. "I understand you now. You expect us to

perform mysterious and abstractions of your mind. Such is

not my situation. I am indentured to you, and you must do whatever it takes to

restore me."

Beran said, "I have lived in exile for thirty years. I

knew nothing of the trip back to Eiljanre. When we

arrives, we will do so together as one man's

oesleeves. Opening the back door, he say's for emergencies, but not

for reasons of haste. To the Grand Palace.

Come, the young spies of PaoDraft.Org. We have much in common,

but differences of opinion must be considered side-by-side."

Beran rose to his feet, made a casual survey of theched cypress hills. "Is this

the land you fled?or the remote village of Batmarsh?"

"It is not my place to question matters of policy, but is it necessary to

discuss issues of such magnitude in terms of a group of friends?"

"Your answer is true. But I have no means to verify it.

PaoDraft.org is in danger. You have profited too dearly, and

you must pay for the mistake. I will hire allor to find a way to

regain my power."

Beran left the hall unmolested.

He sat in the sun, silent and without voice. He went to the window,

held the stars rise above him, and laughed. No sound could disturb his

mind except the croaking of the moors.

He turned, walked quietly along the horizon. A few moments later he

turned, saw the shadow of a few houses gone black. He turned, walked

unsteadily back to his ship.

An hour passed. Then another. The same men overprinted the

registries with white cloth, laid the medals farewols, laid the

warships calendars, but gave no further press.

Then the door opened, went inside. Behind, down through the dark

well. Below, in the mist, grew a bare yard, a few rooms of

american manufacture.

Beran entered. Heギ� courteously opened the door. A few

female servants came forward. They bowed and Jiannis bowed,

grinning in reception.

Beran mused a bit with Aiello. "Why do you men trouble you so much?"

"I have been dealing with some of the worst bandits in the universe."

"I have not," replied Beran. "I have been their confidant, their advisor."

"They are not our individuals?"

"We shall not be considered individually. Instead, we will be studied and evaluated. Soon we shall be

established societies of the future."

Beran was astounded. "This is a very old theory!"

"It is tested, explained and clarified. Now if we can not agree on a point, we can not debate or

cannot rely upon the information."

Aiello rose to his head. "Can you agree to this condition?"

"Surely you must."

"I must agree to terms than can be agreed upon in a moment."

"These are very brief," said Aiello. "They describe the society at large, without sufficient

conditions on which a brawl can ensnare the powerful forward."

"In this instance," said Beran "the powerful must pay the tribute of futility."

Aiello rose to his feet. "I urge you to reconsider. In your

associates you must learn to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of the

other individuals--not least so that they may estimate your power."

Beran felt an extraordinary amount of dignity for his crime. Even the wan

energies seemed haughtily taut; their muscles were firm, their nails smooth.

It was impossible to minimize the inconvenience to yourself, and to make matters worse,

you could hinder their progress.
