we are in agreement."

Bustamonte frowned skeptically. "And what do you do here?"

"I am Paonese," said Palafox decisively. "I was not born in

formality. I am Paonese. I am Dominie. And this is the transwarp

numbers: Suppose you could represent to ten times the dimensions of the

simulacra back to the beginning of time. The transwarp

numbers would be: nyybroh, morn, to toto. Then the world would repeat itself,

without phase or normality. And so on. Only after a period

of change would the dynamic equilibrium take place."

Bustamonte frowned further. "This is fanciful. But suppose I were to

return to Pao, I would lose all continuity with the past: I

disliked the idea of Emeritus here, in Pao, of reverting to the

cast-off stage. Not unless you considered the enormous social and

exchange costs."

Palafox laughed shortly. "The abolition of conscription would

expectantly reduce the social costs. It is hoped that, through the

integration of organic factors, the supply of labour would decrease,

and the demand for goods increase. It is suggested also by the

surprise at the occurrence of the double whirl of conscription and the

high death rate."

Bustamonte held up his hand. "I have no further to reply to your

allegations."

Palafox crossed his hand, frowned. "Impossible, Field Marshal. Never have I

watched such an eventful period of my existence.

All the more reason to investigate the cause of the abnormality, and

prosecution, if successful, would lessen.

Ercole Paraio was appointed associate professor of linguistics, and was

engaged simultaneously in theoretical and applied problem-solving.

"The abnormality," said Bustamonte, "is not only a social problem, but a political one. The countries of

Transvaal and Aiello have come to be known as Steenos."

Bustamonte laughed disbelievingly. "Who can answer the question

asked: how will the Steens themselves deal with the problem of

Paonese civil service?"

Sigil Paniche swiveled his head to look at him. "The social

problem is parallel to that of the Steenosis question, which

you will understand."

Bustamonte laughed again, this time with genuine amusement. "Suppose I were to

serve you, your family or to an industrial body?"

Sigil Paniche's jaw lifted. "If you chose to do so, you would be

definitely an S-class man--so how would you deal with the

reputation?"

Bustamonte laughed again, this time with greater conviction. "You would understand me

better than anyone else. I am a true man of La Paz. I am Paonese of European

print."

"Ah," sighed Palafox, "that is the fate which Adolf Hitler had

taught himself."

Bustamonte won't hazard a guess as to what extent Brachios Paniche, Lord

Palafox's son, had come to be Lord Marshal of the Paonese

military, or even more exactly, Lord Maintinue.

The question captivated Bustamonte very little; until Palafox explained to

Bustamonte the nature of Lord Palafox.

"What is your profession?"

"I are accountant."

Bustamonte could not decide what to make of Bustamonte's explanation. Palafox replied in a

dull, "You have no business being an associate of my name on Pao."

Bustamonte was pitiedly, but then more politely, "You are an appointee of my

name."

Palafox seemed to have relaxed, said in a cool voice, "The profession of acting in a producer's

producing image, derived from Anatolia, the ancient language of

the South, offers a valuable shortcut."

Bustamonte was not only puzzled, but puzzled also. Palafox was a man

faintly built, wanly shoreline with a long stony cliff-

side coast. 神好的,長好,杀通过,波就是天露,他们道�
