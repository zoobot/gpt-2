"I had assumed that you were diligently pursuing your education on Breakness."

"I learned a great deal," said Beran. "And then I lost all heart for further learning."

Palafox's eyes glinted. "Education is not achieved through the heart--it is a systematization of the mental processes."

"But I am something other than a mental process," said Beran. "I'm a man. I must reckon with the whole of myself."

Palafox was thinking, his eyes first contemplating Beran, then sliding

along the line of the Sgolaph crags. When he spoke his voice was amiable.

"There are no absolute certainties in this universe. A man must try to whip order into a yelping pack of probabilities, and uniform success is

impossible."

Beran understood the meaning latent in Palafox's rather general

remarks. "Since you had assured me that you took no further interest in my future, it was necessary that I act for myself. I did so, and returned to Pao."

Palafox nodded. "Beyond question, events took place outside the radius

of my control. Still these rogue circumstances are often as advantageous as

the most carefully nurtured plans."

"Please continue to neglect me in your calculations," said Beran in a carefully passionless voice. "I have learned to enjoy the sense of free

action."

Palafox laughed with an untypical geniality. "Well said! And what do

you think of new Pao?"

"I am puzzled. I have formed no single conviction."

Possibly so, agreed Palafox. And now, if you are

to understand the point, you must understand how the mode of

expression on Pao was chosen. And of late there had been a number of unsettling

events taking place.

The first was the rearrangement of the grammar.

Palafox took care to define almost all the terms upon

the planet, and made them work with precision and precision.

He made Beran into a trifle moody-eyed, a mutt or buster to boot.

"Nowadays Pao is bespeced with bomb-thrusters,

de-facto industrial complex has been disestablished, a fleet of intercontinental

cavalry... And don't forget the Technicants--they comprise only a

small number of the population."

"I have that authority," said Beran. "It is no longer about one man,

but also a multitude."

"But I am no man," said Palafox. "My mission is to

regain power, to seize the initiative. If I act improperly, the status of

me may be insuperable."

Beran thoughtfully fingered the black mark of his mustache. "Other wizards, when impaired in

manship, become less capable. The absentee rule has been broken,

majoraicra have been removed."

Esteban Carbone, Panarch of Pao, arrived at the time to

begrudgingly acceptan offer of a trade-

chest. He said without bias that he was ready to accept, and his

voice was palpable throughout the hall. A person of great

achievement, unobtrusive and entirely new, entered the hall,

without comment.

A fanfare rang out. "Vilnis Batmarsh has reached the final stage of his

dynasty, and will become a Paonese of Batmarsh isann��.

He is in the domain of Taravalli, and must deal with a

 suitable set of people.

He will start with Pao."

Beran rose heavily to his feet. "I have heard a great deal--you must

accept it."

"It is your life, Palafox," said Palafox, "that is forgotten. It is up to you."

Beran rose to his feet. The sound of lungs beating rose,

wood cluttering the floor. He turned, made for the exit, but a

shoulder-print blurred the line of his identification.

Beran hesitated, and in this instant, Palafox once more became

an outlaw.

He flung back the door. The Valiant stepped forth; Palafox

cannot recognize him.

Beran rose to his feet, trod his eyes. He stepped forth

and called back, "Remember, Palafox. There is no room for doubt."

The Valiant stepped forth, pushed Palafox into an opening which

became known
