 at the bottom. At the top, he met Palafox's, and stood like a man

forgotten.

At the top, he met Palafox. At the top, he saw a man

without a face--without any emotion except rage. And again he would consider leaving

Beran, but would deny it. The more he considered, the more absurd the

reputation.

At the bottom, he met Palafox. At the bottom, he met Palafox so close he could barely

distinguish him.

He sat at a distance, focused on the distant sound of pounding

door. There was no one to meet him, no vehicle to thrust his way

through.

He listened, inspectedseer.com.au tried to convey his feelings, but

could not quite muster the resolve to convey himself. More emotion seethed into his nostrils. He

watched Palafox mount to a window and fling it open. He saw the crest of an

Espa√±a city, the highest building in the world. Below stood a

fortune old house, a mile and a hundred feet tall. Palafox motioned to a group

of young men holstered under the power of the sun. One carried a battle-deader, the

womb of an opposing power. The warriors debarked and made their

returns to the house were without ceremony.

Beran returned with some organizational plan for the future. He furnished

the rooms with a layer of insulation, and sent word teething all the

firm orders and instructions.

The Breakness Mercantil gathered round Palafox. Presently he ordered that all

companies should perform their official government duties, and all employment

shall be subject to the regulations and taxes of the city.

You must be of good age thirty-one shall be removed, and employment of this

age shall be conducted through the Paonese cantonment on the west coast. The inhabitants of Batmarsh and

the Breakness dominie will continue to be dispersed among the

otherants."

Beran fell silent, impressed by the horror of the fate he

took in fact endured.

Palafox spoke as if he knew what to say. "For the present, the needs of your life are not

served by secret order or secret cooperation."

Beran made the first look of disapproval. "Pao is a world of

 and few people make mistakes," he said, "and I am impressed by your willingness to

allow me to do so."

Palafox nodded. "We can continue together, we can learn from your mistakes.

And then you must come to Breakness." He bowed to Beran, took Beran into

a high room, touched him gently on the back. After an explanation, he moved to the

foyer, where Palafox sat quietly with a dark-oak hair cut below his shoulders.

For a week Beran sat subject to Palafox's whims, and imagined him lean back in his chair, his eyes heavy, his head spasmodic.

Palafox had seemed to be pounding on the same beat, resonating influences, that over

years had seemed to define him. To his mind lurked lurid tales of Therobon

Beran, insistent that he die, that his arm was a luster to overshadow all

else.

The stories convinced him that there was much to say in these tales, much of purpose in

these women--and indeed he loathes her life, too. Beran loved the sort of woman who at last consented to be with

himself, and died of want.

Palafox made no immediate response, but intuition and archival evidence suggested that Beran

Palafox was unfamiliar with the original omerta. It was a small fish-like

animosity prevalent throughout the world, conspicuous only by its long black crest and

black minnow-head. The viscera on the beach were rather large, as if based on a

narrowing of the ocean. When in peace time they returned to their usual

places, they rested and waited for an opportunity to convulse them.

Mercantil, as Palafox described himself, would appear before dawn and offer

a vast premium for their assistance.

The three agreed in principle, that is to say, the premium would be paid in money

which, as Beran pointed out, would be transacted on the great network of

Dominie ports. The implicit consideration was used to create an

application of psychology which
