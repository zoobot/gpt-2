. Pao is vast and vast, a world of

figures and threads, and bits and bobs of flesh and bone. Each costume

has its special power and place in the universe. At the Institute you will

learn how to make weapons of pure steel and simple

energetics, and at the end of the day you will make yourself stand on

Momentary Supremacy."

Beran fell silent. At last he said, "I think I have passed the third string of my

recitation. Begone,--come back with me on your way back to Breakness."

She flew away in a black cocoon.

Beran, looking across the chasm,

found himself unable to move. "Where is he going?"

"In the sky?"

Beran made little answer. "In the past, on Nonamand, he has lived

on Breakness."

"And on Pao?"

Beran shook his head. "There is no way of knowing."

"There is, however, a way--one that can be drawn

under the influence of data and explained to Menelaus."

"Yes, yes," breathed Bustamonte. "I have been thinking about Bustamonte's

program, and I am worried. I am thinking also of Pao, and of Paoising, and of

Bustamonte's total takeover. When you think of Breakness, you would

not-unless you were ready to accept the inevitability of death."

"But I am not ready to accept the inevitability?"

"Not unless you accept the inevitability of death."

Bustamonte laughed prevalently, and openly expressed an opinion varying

among himself. All men die. There is no simple will behind all

the decisions. Isolation from the outside world is intolerable.

On the morning of Beran's birth, twenty-eight students of the Institute were

excommunicated. The government, concerned at the spread of Communism,

ordered an investigation. The faculty was established to facilitate the

development of thought and action, and the procedures of

faculty study were academic, not emotional.

An eclectic student body took to the air, singing the ancient Paonese melody,

aving bursts of movement and expelling the competitors. Their screams

were aperitif, a shrieking chant, a clatter, a clatter, a

crowdingunited, and the chant died; the crowd died, the

cry came silent hoarsely, the chant died, and burst forth a

crowdingthat was both magnificent and sudden. The bowed and broken bowed

and gathered about Bustamonte, shouting and hoarsely, until dawn.

The Mamarone stood blanched and helpless, silent and silent, as if nothing

had happened.

There was a sound from outside, a faint chorus of calls, a wild "Rip-rip-

rip!"

Bustamonte's heart sank, his jaw sagged. This was the hunting chivvy of

the Brumbos, the clan call.

The Mamarone sounded like men of foreign extraction. They

exclaimed and debarked the tavern. All were老�

madness-disgust, and many faint, nervous, and

madness-stricken. A dozen of the Mamarone came forward and roared

At dawn, when the clansmen included. They turned and fled the

table.

Deirombonaan, speaking another Deirombonaan, spoke a words long in the

outCOME! tune. "How many ships have you of yours from Breakness,

Palafox confidant?"

Deirombonaan showed a curious giddiness which amused us both

and which showed us excellent pleasure to learn.

"Twenty ships, twenty from Sector 262, one at a time."

"Twenty from each sector? Thirty-eight from the

norm, thirty from each arm's reach?" Beran inquired.

"One week, all ship."

"One week, two weeks, three weeks?"

"Three weeks, the final burst of energy!"

"Four, the energy is wasted, the weapons too short?"

Beran assented gloomily. "Four, they explode."

The three of us took twenty-four hours, passed through the eager

café, and at sunset struck for the episode's second episode: the

imprint.

The traders were dealt a fatal blow by the second shock, and, in the

case of the Brumbo
