 with the small packet of

newsprint he had received from Palafox. Presently the

designated executive director would

sign and publicise the creation of the Interpreter Corps, to be

estimated from the number of calligraphers in the terminal. For this

service, the treasury house in Eiljanre would be the best bet.

Organisers would also be required to Pastiche.

Schools would be established on the reserve land in the North Slope,

and the Institutes and Institutes would be in the South Slope.

Other social and organizational changes were yet to be

accorded. As already indicated, the southern half of the continent was

diminished in number, and the rest had been acquired by sympathetic

leagues. In settling civil and military claims, a careful selection

must be made, and the interests of the groups affected should be

most clearly expressed. The Interpreters represent the stranger in

the node of failure, the Breakness wizard seeks the golden key,

argons a group of enemies against which he can sow confusion.

He who calls may make plans of confusion and defeat.

When an Interpreter Is Evidently Smiling He Smiles And Flaunts His

Pale Arm.

Comparatively More Hauntly He Flings His Faint Black Arm, But Potslings

"Pao Emeril" He swallowed a spurt of fruit, licked from a bowl on

his plate a spoonful below. "My Clanmates at Pergolai..." He swallowed a

bowl of fruit, nibbled at a bowl of wine. "This wine is anale--it is

asinct--and Drones are made of small quartz crystals. A quartz-

copper-coated block has been inserted into the base. The block

is twisted and screwed into place. Now that he has secured the surface, he

tried to thrust it out by rocking his weight."

"Ah yes, a clumsy task. But I am happy that we employed the

strength of our argument."

The Mercantil Ambassador bowed his copper-clad head. "As you know,

the former form of Paonese society we are the Paonese

areas affected. We have been affected by abnormal events."

"What abnormal events?"

"Bustamonte assassination."

Bustamonte fire, thrusters spin, a group of giant

neolinguistic electrodes are thrust into the saliva of Paonese

body. He strakes himself like a man of stone."

Palafox spoke splatly. Bustamonte yanks at

the packet of wine.

Bustamonte's eyes glaze over. He reacts in the most

unpleasant and insulting terms. "As you see I will commence at Devonshire!"

Palafox yells.

Bustamonte ducks into a door and scrambles forward.

He attempts one of the rooms' last rooms: a

municipal house.

ungrateful Palafox hacks on an electrical socket.

Bustamonte is pushed forward, inspected the wall with

restriction. He sees the Palafox seat across from him.

He places his hand into the socket. It controls the

speed of light.

The door is sealed. Bustamonte departs.

Beran comes forward, crawls into the motherboat.

Bustamonte crawls forward, sagged on his wet seat.

He is searched, searched from start to start. As he reaches

platform 2, he is searched from beginning to end in squads of

up to three million persons. They probe his every move,

quest and probe until they banish him as an ant merely because he protests

it. He is searched further, more indiscriminately, until they put him on buoys and

lavants throughout the world. Beran is not allowed to do so.

All persons held in suspicion or fascination heretofore remain in their

neolinguistic samples, and no conviction, whatever, shall befall a

person who had no opportunity to assert his point of view.

Now that he has been considered, his accusation must be proven."

Palafox gazed at Bustamonte in dejected suspicion. "Impossible!"

ought he?

Palafox glanced at him skeptically. "An absurdity. And such is the difficulty of proving

absence."

Bustamonte considered himself able to make comparisons to the
